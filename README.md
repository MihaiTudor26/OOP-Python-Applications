# OOP-Python-Tutorial 🎓

We will just cover the basics of object-oriented programming. Object-oriented programming
is used extensively in software design 👨🏻‍💻. Python is an object-oriented programming language. An object consists of two things:
data and functions (called methods) that work with that data. As an example, strings in Python are
objects. The data of the string object is the actual characters that make up that string. The methods
are things like lower, replace, and split. In Python, everything is an object. That includes not
only strings and lists, but also integers, floats, and even functions themselves. A class is a template for objects. It contains the code for all the object’s methods.
These are just some of the notions that we will introduce in the file 👨🏽‍🏫 oop_python_tutorial.py. We will apply this theoretical background in some practical applications 📝 oop_python_application.py.
